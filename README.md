# Python code Protection Mechanisms

Playground for python based project obfuscation techniques.

## Description

In this repository I'll demo and try the different options available at the
moment to protect a codebase based on python in order to avoid snooping from
third-parties, options like source obfuscation, byte-code distribution, etc
will be implemented and reviewed, later combinations of several techniques will
be tried too.

## Organization

The target is the project at the [app](app) directory, then each method will
reside in a directory with a ``setup.sh`` script that will setup and run the
particular technique. Also a ``README.md`` should be available in each
directory explaining the current option, highlighting its pro and cons.
